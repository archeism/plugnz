# omp store layout

Measured 2026-09-16 on this machine (`~/.omp`). Reader: `src/hosts/omp.ts`.

omp is a **native plugin host with its own store** (AGENTS.md hosts list,
landed in main as `d1db50f`; ground-truth "Correction" 2026-09-16). It is
never routed through a repository-root `.mcp.json`.

## Store

```
~/.omp/plugins/installed_plugins.json
  # claude-code-shaped registry:
  { "version": 2, "plugins": { "<name>@<marketplace>": [
      { "scope": "user", "installPath": "<abs>", "version": "<v>",
        "installedAt": "…", "lastUpdated": "…" } ] } }

~/.omp/plugins/cache/plugins/<marketplace>___<name>___<version>/
  # flat triple-underscore keys (unlike claude-code's nested cache layout)
  plugin.json                 # root manifest (spec-style; no inline mcpServers measured)
  .cursor-plugin/ .claude-plugin/ .codex-plugin/   # dereferenced host manifests
  skills/<skill>/SKILL.md

~/.omp/plugins/omp-plugins.lock.json
  { "plugins": { "<name>": { "version": "…", "enabled": true, "enabledFeatures": null } },
    "settings": {} }

~/.omp/plugins/node_modules/<name>   # symlinks into cache/plugins/ dirs

~/.omp/plugins/plgnz/<hex-marketplace>-<hex-plugin>/
  package.json                       # {name:"@plgnz/<hex>-<hex>",version,omp:{}}
  plugin.json                        # original Agent Plugin manifest
  skills/                            # ordinary model-visible skills
  commands/                          # source commands + namespaced manual skills
  .plgnz/source/                     # byte-preserved source/resources for commands
  .plgnz-install.json                # plgnz ownership marker

~/.omp/plugins/node_modules/@plgnz/<hex-marketplace>-<hex-plugin>
  # native npm/link extension-package symlink into plugins/plgnz/

~/.omp/marketplaces.json
  { "version": 1, "marketplaces": [ { "name": "personal", "sourceType": "local",
      "sourceUri": "<abs path>", "catalogPath": "<abs marketplace.json>", … } ] }
```

## Reader decisions

- The host is **present iff `~/.omp/plugins/` exists** — a repo-root
  `.mcp.json` in the cwd must never conjure the omp host or its findings.
- plgnz-owned installs are enumerated from marker-bearing `plugins/plgnz/`
  packages whose `node_modules/@plgnz/*` link still points at the package.
  Their public identity remains `<plugin>@<marketplace>`; the scoped npm name
  is an OMP-native implementation detail. Foreign marketplace installs still
  come from `installed_plugins.json`, with the flat cache fallback.
- `enabled` comes from `omp-plugins.lock.json`, keyed by scoped npm package
  name for plgnz packages and bare plugin name for legacy marketplace rows.
- **MCP surface**: installed plugins' `.mcp.json`/`mcp.json` only. No install
  on this machine declares any MCP today (all four are skills-only), so this
  half is defensive and exercised by fixtures. omp has **no measured
  user-level MCP config** (`~/.omp/mcp.json` does not exist), so doctor's
  shadow check has no user side to trip on for omp in v0.
- **Repo-root `.mcp.json` deliberately not read.** omp sessions do consult the
  workspace `.mcp.json` (pre-Correction evidence line in the ground-truth
  doc), but that file is the Claude Code project-level convention: reading it
  under omp would attribute another host's project servers to omp (double
  reporting) and make doctor output depend on the cwd. If a later phase wires
  omp's session config in, it must come from omp's own documented config
  resolution, not from the shared project file.
- No staleness source: omp's registry has no sha column; unknown-staleness
  applies until `add` records one in state.json.

## Pin

`pin` rewrites the bare `command` of every stdio server in an install dir's
`.mcp.json` / `mcp.json`. No install on this machine declares MCP yet, so the
path is defensive like the reader's. omp is not a GUI host and is not a
default `pin` target. Rationale: `docs/pin-and-update.md`.

## Evidence paths (read 2026-09-16)

- `~/.omp/plugins/installed_plugins.json` — registry (e.g. `mattpocock@personal` → `installPath` into `cache/plugins/personal___mattpocock___0.1.0`)
- `~/.omp/plugins/cache/plugins/personal___{personal,toolbox,try-skill,mattpocock}___0.1.0/` — install dirs; root `plugin.json` keys `[$schema, name, version, description, author, skills]`; no mcp files
- `~/.omp/plugins/omp-plugins.lock.json` — enabled/version lock
- `~/.omp/plugins/node_modules/` — symlinks into the cache
- `~/.omp/marketplaces.json` — marketplace registry (`sourceType: local`, `sourceUri`, `catalogPath`)
- omakase-distribution-state-2026-09-16.md — "Correction" section: omp is a
  native plugin host (`omp plugin install|…|doctor|upgrade|marketplace`,
  `~/.omp/plugins` store); the earlier "reads repo-root .mcp.json" line
  describes omp's session config, not its plugin surface

## Native lifecycle and projection

- OMP 18.1.4 treats enabled npm/link packages containing `package.json` with
  `omp:{}` as native extension packages. One package root discovers `skills/`,
  `commands/`, hooks, tools, rules, prompts, and MCP together. This is the
  native plugin route used by plgnz; it is separate from standalone skill
  fanout and from the narrower Agent Plugin marketplace provider.
- Ordinary skills remain in `skills/`. A skill marked
  `disable-model-invocation:true` moves out of public skill discovery and is
  emitted as `<plugin>:<skill>` under `commands/`. Source commands use the
  same `<plugin>:<command>` namespace, including rewritten references between
  commands. Command bodies keep OMP's native `$1` and `$ARGUMENTS`
  expansion and receive the final `.plgnz/source/...` base directory, where
  all source resources are preserved. `user-invocable:false` and other
  unpreserved invocation/permission gates are refused before mutation.
- plgnz stages the complete extension package, swaps a marker-owned package,
  link, and lock entry transactionally, and rolls the old active package back
  if activation or metadata persistence fails. Same-version byte changes
  refresh the package. Removal requires both the ownership marker and the
  expected native link.
- `--adopt-existing` migrates only the selected user marketplace row at its
  exact contained flat cache slot, matching manifest identity and version.
  Symlinked or outside-cache paths are refused. Legacy bytes are deleted only
  after the native package is active and only when no retained registry row
  references them.
- The earlier marketplace-only finding remains accurate in
  [`evidence/omp-command-discovery-20260923.json`](../evidence/omp-command-discovery-20260923.json):
  marketplace roots do not reach OMP's command provider. The native package
  result and empty-cwd lifecycle proof are recorded in
  [`evidence/omp-native-extension-package-20260923.json`](../evidence/omp-native-extension-package-20260923.json).

## Open
- Whether omp will read plugin `mcp.json` (spec §7.2.1) or a native
  equivalent when plugins declare MCP is unknown — nothing on disk declares
  any yet.
- omp's own user-level/session MCP config location (if any) is unverified;
  see the reader-decision above before wiring one in.

## OMP 18.10.3 admission (2026-10-13)

The same native extension-package route was reproduced with the installed
18.10.3 native loader in an isolated HOME and empty cwd. The opt-in test now
accepts `OMP_SOURCE` so the source under test is explicit. Its direct-writer
mode tests the managed writer and actual native discovery without conflating
that evidence with public CLI planner admission. All 21 assertions passed,
including manual-only exclusion, namespaced commands, argument expansion,
same-version refresh, failed projection preservation and removal. Focused
writer/adapter tests separately exercise transactional rollback and readback.
After canonical source identity repair, the complete public CLI probe also passed
all 21 assertions (6.19s), including add, refresh, refusal preservation and removal.
Exact releases 18.1.4 and 18.10.3 are admitted; no intervening/future-version
compatibility interval is inferred. See
[`evidence/omp-native-extension-package-20261013.json`](../evidence/omp-native-extension-package-20261013.json).
